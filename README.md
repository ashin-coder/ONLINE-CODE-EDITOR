## Installation

To use the Online Code Editor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ashin-coder/online-code-editor.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Extract the "codemirror-5.65.3.rar" file into the project folder.
4. Launch the editor by opening the "index.html" file in a web browser.
5. Start using the Online Code Editor to develop your web projects.

**Please Note**: The current implementation of the Online Code Editor only supports JavaScript (JS) functionality when written inside functions.

## Implementation

The Online Code Editor project is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to provide an intuitive and lightweight environment for developing simple web projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The user interface of the Online Code Editor is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to navigate effortlessly and enhance productivity. The GUI incorporates a clean and user-friendly layout, ensuring a smooth experience for developers of all skill levels.

To ensure optimal performance on basic computer specifications, the project is optimized to be lightweight. This means that the code editor is designed to consume minimal system resources while providing a seamless development experience.

The Online Code Editor supports comprehensive language features for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides syntax highlighting, which visually distinguishes different elements of the code for easier comprehension. Additionally, line numbers are displayed to facilitate code organization and referencing.

One of the convenient features of the editor is the Reset option, this functionality allows users to restore the editor to its initial state effortlessly. This feature proves useful when experimenting with code or starting a new project.

Users can import code from their local systems and modify it within the editor. The project also offers the ability to save projects, enabling users to store their work and retrieve it later. This functionality ensures that users can conveniently work on their projects from different devices or collaborate with others.

The integration of CodeMirror, a popular JavaScript library, enhances the code display and provides additional development features. Auto tag closure automatically completes HTML tags, reducing the chances of syntax errors. The integration also includes different themes, allowing users to customize the editor's appearance according to their preferences.

The Online Code Editor provides two layout options to maximize comfort and readability. Users can choose between a single-pane view or a split-pane view, depending on their coding preferences.

To enhance coding skills conveniently, the project integrates learning resources. The "More" option in the editor provides direct access to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials from W3Schools. This integration enables users to refer to the documentation and learn new concepts without leaving the code editor environment.

**Please Note**: As mentioned before please extract the "codemirror-5.65.3.rar" file inside the project file before running the project since it contains plugins used for code highlightings and other functions

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the developers and contributors of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the CodeMirror, a JavaScript component used in this project, for providing the tools and resources and also those who provided the knowledge and support to make this Online Code Editor project possible. The icon used in this project was sourced from Flaticon, a platform for high-quality icons. I appreciate the creator of this icon for their work

## Limitations

**Please Note**: The current implementation of the Online Code Editor project has a limitation in terms of its supported languages. It is specifically designed to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. While these languages cover a wide range of web development needs, it does mean that other programming languages are not supported within the editor also, the project currently supports only single-page development.

Additionally, the editor has a specific constraint related to JavaScript (JS) functionality. It supports JavaScript code execution only when written inside functions. This means that JavaScript code should be enclosed within function blocks for it to be executed and produce the desired results within the editor. Any standalone JavaScript code outside of functions may not be executed or behave as expected.

Considering this constraint, it is recommended to adhere to writing JavaScript code within function blocks while utilizing the editor's capabilities for JavaScript development. This ensures that the JavaScript functionality is properly interpreted and executed within the editor environment. It is important to keep these limitations in mind when working with the editor.
